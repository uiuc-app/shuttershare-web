# Overview #

Shuttershare app makes sharing photos with your friends and family extremely easy.
Nearly every smartphone sold today has a camera, and photo-sharing is incredibly popular. While the photo-sharing market is very mature, ShutterShare provides a service that is currently lacking: unbeatable ease-of-use.

# What's out there #

There are apps that allow you to take pictures and immediately choose who to send them to, but choosing people disrupts the user flow and is annoying. There are services that allow you to select existing photos and share them with particular people, but it takes time, the pictures are not as current, and you may forget to send them altogether. There are services that allow you to automatically send all of your photos to social media sites or the cloud, but that lacks both privacy and a personal connection that photos are intended to provide.

# How ShutterShare is different #

Our app allows users to define groups of contacts, and from that point forth, the app automatically updates photos captured within the app to the contacts. It adds no extra steps beyond opening the app.
